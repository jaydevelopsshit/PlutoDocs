## Tile
A Tile is an object that can contain a <a href="#block">Block</a> and/or a <a href="#wall">Wall</a>, or be empty. Tiles make up Terraria worlds.

## Block
A Block is an object in Terraria worlds that can be interacted with physically, as well as be placed and broken among other things. Even though many wikis call this a tile, for the purpose of clarity, we will call this a block.

## Wall
A Wall is an object in Terraria worlds that acts as a second layer behind blocks, you cannot physically interact with them, but you can place and break them, as well as put certain things on them, such as torches.

## UID
An ID that must be unique in the current context.
